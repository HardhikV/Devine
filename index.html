								<h2 class="major">RP Rules</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> <h2>Basic Rules </h2>
1.VDM also known as Vehicle Deathmatch  is totally not allowed In RP. VDM means to kill or injure anyone intentionally using any vehicle. As if we kill anyone or hit with the vehicle the person who got hit by the Car will not have any opportunity to save his life. He only has the option to lose his life and no other option is left for him.<br> <br>
2.RDM also known as Random Deathmatch means killing someone with Guns and Weapons without doing any proper RP with him. According to this rule we can not directly kill or shoot anyone without involving in any RP scenario with him. We can not go and directly kill anyone without talking with him and without giving proper time to him to save his life. RDM is totally not allowed in RP.<br> <br>
3.Fail RP is an act of not following RP Rules and performing non-realistic acts in any RP which is nearly impossible in Real Life Scenario. In RP we live the life of our Fictional Character as real life so we can not do any non-realistic things that can not be possible in real life. we have to behave like our character and not use any game mechanics to do Stunts and harmful things that are not possible in our Real Life. According to this rule we have to be in our character and not come out of the character again and again and do non-sense things. Doing these things in RP will be considered as Fail-RP.<br> <br>
4.Fear RP means we should have fear of our life all the time while doing RP. Having Fear of our Life is very necessary in Real LIfe as well as RP because in RP we live the life of our character and we have to take care of our life because every life is precious in RP also.<br> <br>
5.Power Gaming is an advantage in RP scenario by using in-game mechanics. Basically it means when we don't give any chance to the opponent to defend himself and make him self safe from that case and we don't leave any chance to the opponent except losing then it will be considered as Power Gaming which is not allowed In RP.<br> <br>
6.Metagaming is the act when we use information from Outside in the RP without Getting any information about that thing in the RP. If we use any information going out of the character will be considered as Meta Gaming which is strictly Prohibited in the RP. Stream Sniping is also a part of Meta Gaming because in this also we use Information from outside the Game.<br> <br>
7.Combat Logging:- Combat Logging means to log out or disconnect from the game or RP. Like if we are in an RP scenario and we Press 'F8' and quit the game and leave that scenario to save myself then it will be considered as Combat Logging because in real life we can not run away from any scenario.<br> <br>
8.Character Mixing:-Mixing of Two or more character's Knowledge of RP to gain profit or advantage is known as Character Mixing. It means when we use knowledge of one character and to gain advantage in the second character then it is known as Character Mixing.<br> <br>
9.Cop Baiting:- Cop Baiting means involving Cops into a RP scenario again and again without any reason or without creating Proper RP then it is known as COP Baiting.<br> <br>
10.New Life Rule:- When a new life starts, your character will forget all the information and events leading up to your death. However, you are still the same character (same job, gang, friends). New Life Starts when you are taking re-spawn or executed.  After respawn you forget 15 minutes(of real life) RP and you can not enter the area of 100m of that situation.<br> <br>
11.Progressive RP:- When you enter the city for the first time you need to explore the city first. You have to make friends and then have to start a journey by knowing the people and city & other kinds of exploration. Also you need to continue your backstory.<br> <br>
12.Supportive RP:- When another player is creating a scenario with you. You have to continue that scenario with that player.</p>
